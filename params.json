Then the framework will automatically pick up an Neural Network\r\nconfiguration to fulfill your demand. With support from several backend(CPU, GPU, etc.), this framework can execute with satisfying speed.\r\n\r\nPresent this framework is rudimentary, we hope if more people hold the same perspective or just interested in this project and join us and make the contribution:)\r\n\r\n",
